I also have 2 diplomas from my training at an academy and learning a lot about web design.

It was like stepping into a whole new dimension of learning, and now I feel way more confident about navigating the online business scene.</p>

It was hands-on and fun, and we learned heaps about how to get noticed in the digital world.</p>
